# Project Objective

I created this project with the main goal of analyzing healthcare data to uncover meaningful insights that can improve hospital performance, patient outcomes, and overall financial efficiency.
In this project, I focused on: Cleaning and transforming raw healthcare data using Python Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and trends Creating interactive Power BI Dashboards for data visualization and storytelling

## 2. Dataset Used
- Source: Kaggle Healthcare Dataset
- Format: CSV file
- Rows: 100,000+
- Columns: 20+ (Patient info, hospital, department, disease, cost, etc.)
- Dataset Link: < a href="https://github.com/khush3521/Healthcare-Analysis-Excel-Pythone-PowerBI/blob/main/processed_healthcare_data.csv"> Datasets</a>


## QUESTIONS (KPIs) & Process 
1 FINANCIAL DASHBOARD (5 Questions)
- Which hospital generates the highest revenue and which departments contribute most to it?
  - Purpose: Identify top-performing hospitals and their revenue sources
  - Use: Resource allocation and expansion planning
- What is the payment status distribution and how much amount is outstanding?
  - Purpose: Monitor cash flow and pending payments
  - Use: Accounts receivable management
- How does insurance coverage compare to out-of-pocket expenses across different departments?
  - Purpose: Understand patient financial burden patterns
  - Use: Insurance partnership strategies
- Which doctors have the highest treatment costs and what is their patient outcome rate?
  - Purpose: Analyze cost-effectiveness of treatments
  - Use: Performance benchmarking
- What is the monthly revenue trend and are there seasonal patterns?
  - Purpose: Track financial performance over time
  - Use: Budget forecasting and planning

2 CLINICAL DASHBOARD (5 Questions)
- What is the average length of stay by department and how does it relate to treatment costs?
  - Purpose: Identify efficiency across departments
  - Use: Operational optimization
- Which are the top 5 most common diseases and their recovery rates?
  - Purpose: Understand disease prevalence and treatment effectiveness
  - Use: Resource planning and specialization
- How does patient outcome vary by severity level across different hospitals?
  - Purpose: Measure quality of care
  - Use: Quality improvement initiatives
- What is the monthly patient admission trend and are there peak periods?
  - Purpose: Understand patient flow patterns
  - Use: Staff scheduling and capacity planning
- How does patient demographic (age/gender) distribution correlate with different medical conditions?
  - Purpose: Identify risk patterns in population
  - Use: Preventive healthcare programs

## Project Insight 
- Department X has the highest patient load but moderate recovery rate
- City Y contributes maximum patients, indicating high demand in that region
- Recovery rate is strongly correlated with early diagnosis
- Longer hospital stays lead to higher treatment costs

## 7. Final Conclusion
- This project demonstrates how data analytics and visualization can improve decision-making in healthcare.By using Python for analysis and Power BI for dashboards, we can identify cost-saving opportunities, improve patient outcomes, and support better hospital management decisions.
