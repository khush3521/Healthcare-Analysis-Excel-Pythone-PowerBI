# Project Objective

I created this project with the main goal of analyzing healthcare data to uncover meaningful insights that can improve hospital performance, patient outcomes, and overall financial efficiency.
In this project, I focused on: Cleaning and transforming raw healthcare data using Python Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and trends Creating interactive Power BI Dashboards for data visualization and storytelling
